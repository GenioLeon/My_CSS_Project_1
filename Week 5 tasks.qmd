## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
quarto::quarto_render("docname.qmd") --to html/pdf
```

## Pandoc fenced div

Start and end with equal number of : - minimum of 3 ::: Add curly brackets to indicate the start/end of class {.class} or {sometimes-class}

::: class
All this content can be modified
:::

Or layout things in separate columns:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](image.png){fig-alt="Description of image 1"}

![](image2.png){fig-alt="Description of image 1"}
:::

## Panel Tabsets

You can split up and flip between sections of a page, rather than having two columns for instance

::: panel-tabset
### Element 1

```{r}
#| eval: false
head(mtcars)
```

### Element 2

...content...
:::

## Footnotes

You can create inline footnotes like so: some inline text with a\[\^1\] \[\^1\]: footnote

## Customising chunk output:

::: panel-tabset
-   **eval: false** prevents code from being evaluated. (And obviously if the code is not run, no results will be generated). This is useful for displaying example code, or for disabling a large block of code without commenting each line

-   **include: false** runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. Use this for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report

-   **echo: false** prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.

-   **message: false** or warning: false prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the finished file.

## Figure Sizing:

::: panel-tabset

fig-width, fig-height, fig-asp, out-width and out-height
